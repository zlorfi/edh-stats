            Welcome to EDH Stats Tracker
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            By creating an account and using EDH Stats Tracker, you agree to these Terms of Service. 
            We've kept them simple and straightforward—no legal jargon that makes your brain hurt. (You're welcome.)
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            1. What This Service Is
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            EDH Stats Tracker is a web application designed to help Magic: The Gathering players track, 
            analyze, and celebrate their EDH/Commander game statistics. We store your game records, 
            commanders, and associated statistics. Think of us as your personal game journal that actually does math for you.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            2. User Accounts
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You agree not to share your account 
            credentials with anyone else. If someone logs into your account and logs all your games as losses, we'll sympathize, 
            but that's on you.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            You represent that the information you provide during registration is accurate and true. 
            If you use a fake name, that's between you and Magic's lore team.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            3. Your Content
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            All game records, commander lists, notes, and data you enter into EDH Stats Tracker remain your property. 
            We don't own your stats—we just help you organize them. We won't sell your data, trade it for pack equity, or share it with strangers. 
            (We're not monsters.)
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            4. Acceptable Use

            Don't try to break the service through hacking, automated attacks, or other malicious means.

            5. Service Availability
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We aim to keep EDH Stats Tracker available and reliable. However, like all software, 
            it may occasionally go down for maintenance or experience technical issues. We're doing our best here.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We reserve the right to make changes to the service, add features, or modify functionality 
            as we see fit. We'll try to keep breaking changes to a minimum.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            6. Limitation of Liability
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            EDH Stats Tracker is provided "as is." While we work hard to make it great, 
            we don't guarantee it will be perfect or meet every need. We're not liable for data loss, 
            lost wins, or your opponent's lucky top-decks.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            7. Changes to Terms
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. We'll let you know about significant changes. 
            Your continued use of the service after changes means you accept the new terms.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            8. Account Termination
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            You can delete your account at any time. Your data will be removed from our systems 
            in accordance with our privacy practices. If you violate these terms, we may disable your account.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            9. Questions?
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            If you have questions about these terms, please reach out. We're reasonable people 
            (at least we think so).
          </p>

              <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Use the service as intended, keep your password safe, it's your responsibility.
